# Bikesharing
Using Tableau and data from the Citi Bike program in New York City, we will work for a possible bikesharing bussiness in Des Moines presentation.
Tableau will help to predict if the bike-share company idea could work in Des Moines.

# What we want to present
- How many trips were recorded during the month of August?
- What Is the Proportion of Short-Term Customers to Annual Subscribers?
- What Are Peak Riding Hours in the Month of August?
- What Are the Top Bike Stations in the City for Starting a Journey?
- What Are the Top Bike Stations for Ending a Journey?
- What Is the Gender Breakdown of Active Riders?
- What Is the Average Trip Duration by Age?
- Which Bikes Are Most Likely Due for Repair?
- How Variable Is Bike Utilization?

# Purpose and Audience
It's important to understand our audience when creating a dashboard in order to ensure the data is relevant to them. Now, we want to impress some investors so they may be more interested in the specific locations where bikes will be stored, number of people using it, so if it retiable. Therefore, we want to show investors the most relevant data so that they support the Des Moines bike-sharing business.


### Although NY City has a larger population and a large number of tourists, knowing the way City Bike users rent their bikes, will help us understand user profiles in order to replicate successfully in the city of Des Moines.
